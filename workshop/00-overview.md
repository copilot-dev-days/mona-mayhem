# 🎮 Mona Mayhem Workshop

## Build a GitHub Contribution Battle Arena with Copilot

Welcome to the Mona Mayhem workshop! You'll build a retro arcade-themed web application that compares GitHub contribution graphs between two users — all using GitHub Copilot as your AI pair programmer.

## What You'll Build

**Mona Mayhem** is a full-stack web app where users can enter two GitHub usernames and see their contribution activity displayed side-by-side in a neon-lit retro arcade style. Think Street Fighter, but for GitHub contributions! 🕹️

### Features
- ⚡ Real-time GitHub contribution data fetching
- 📊 Side-by-side contribution graph visualization
- 🎮 Retro arcade UI with glowing neon effects and animations
- 🔌 Server-side API proxy to handle CORS
- 📱 Responsive design for all screen sizes
